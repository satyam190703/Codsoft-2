It includes the use of html tags such as audio, video, img, nav,footer etc. It includes the use of CSS styles like grid, flex, background styles, use of Keyframe animations,hover etc. audio tags are used to add background audio which plays when the page is loaded. video tags are used to display promotion and visual experience of the vehicle.The footer tag contains the contact details, FAQs, a copyright notice to protect my work etc. All these tags enhance the user experience.
